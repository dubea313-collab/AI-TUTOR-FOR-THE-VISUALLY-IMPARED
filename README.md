# AI Tutor for the Visually Impaired

## Project Status
Working prototype (assistive system proof-of-concept)

## Overview
The AI Tutor for the Visually Impaired is an assistive learning system designed
to help visually impaired users access educational content through voice-based
interaction and audio feedback. The system allows users to interact without the
need for a screen, keyboard, or mouse.

The project focuses on accessibility, simplicity, and hands-free operation using
embedded hardware and basic AI or logic-based processing.

## Key Features
- Voice-based user interaction
- Audio feedback responses
- Hands-free operation
- Designed for visually impaired users
- Prototype-level assistive learning system

## Hardware Used
- Microcontroller / Single Board Computer (ESP32 / Arduino / Raspberry Pi)
- Microphone module
- Speaker or audio output module
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply

## Software / Technologies
- Embedded C / Python (depending on implementation)
- Audio input capture
- Logic-based or basic AI response system

## System Operation
1. The user speaks a command or question.
2. The microphone captures the audio input.
3. The system processes the input using predefined logic or AI techniques.
4. A suitable response is generated.
5. The response is delivered as audio output through a speaker.
6. The system returns to listening mode.

## Limitations
- Prototype-level implementation
- Limited vocabulary or predefined responses
- No advanced natural language processing
- No optimized enclosure or PCB

## Future Improvements
- Integration of advanced speech recognition and NLP
- Cloud-based knowledge access
- Multi-language support
- Portable enclosure design
- Improved audio processing and accuracy
